Creat a new folder, drag the 'ref.dat' and 'Pd_foil.dat' (the extention name has to be '*.dat')
The data should have just two columns, first: energy, second: log(Io/It) 
Add '#' at the beginning of first line.
Open origin Lab, drap the 'Pd_foil' data file into a worksheet. Change the first colomn to 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, etc...
Export ASCII file and choose space as seperator.
Open ID24-calibration software, load spectra: first ref, second raw data.
Drap and zoom make them identical as much as possible.
Click Calibrate.
Save into a new folder (eg. ID24-cali).
Open the new '.dat' file in athena, compare with reference data.
if not OK, tune the raw data in ID24-cali software again and cali, then save as '***-2', compare again and select the best one.
use the best one's first column to replace all the data's first column.
