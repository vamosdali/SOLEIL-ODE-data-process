The data should have just two columns, first: energy, second: log(Io/It) 
Add '#' at the beginning of first line.
Open origin Lab, drap the 'Pd_foil' data file into a worksheet. Change the first colomn to 1.01, 1.02, 1.03, etc...
Export ASCII file and choose space as seperator.
Open ID24-calibration software, load spectra: first ref, second raw data.
Drap and zoom make them identical as much as possible.
